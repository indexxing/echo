# Echo

A simple Bluesky bot with responses powered by Gemini. Echo doesn't have long-term memory like other Bluesky bots such as [Void](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mxzuau6m53jtdsbqe6f4laov), [Luna](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uxelaqoua6psz2for5amm6bp), or [Penelope](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yokspuz7ha7rf5mrqmhgdtxw). This was mainly just to play around with making a Bluesky bot, and the [@skyware/bot](https://github.com/skyware-js/bot) library makes it really easy, which was nice.
